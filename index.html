            <p>In its Sixth Assessment Report, the IPCC forwards 5 “high confidence” predictions about the risks of
              climate related disasters:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Climate change is already affecting weather in every region of the globe.</li>
              <li>Every increment of warming will intensify hazards.</li>
              <li>Climatic and non-climatic risks interact, creating cascading risks, which are more complex and harder
                to manage.</li>
              <li>Resilient development is enabled by cooperation, including access to financial resources, inclusive
                governance and coordinated policies.</li>
              <li>Adaptation and mitigation measures this decade Delayed action will lock-in high-emissions, raise risks
                of stranded assets and increase losses.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As the future unfolds, what comes to pass next will take the place of the present in the next run–herein
              lies the recursivity of simulation. As the future unfolds, what comes to pass next will take the place of
              the present in the next run–herein lies the recursivity of simulation. Although the IPCC lacks the tools
              to produce or negate the futures it scries in simulation, its foresight is significant. IPCC foresight is
              a germ of a planetary sapience, a self-responsibilization of our species against the backdrop of an
              otherwise certain doom. The IPCC art of foresight is, however, not a transhistorical given. This
              simulative knack beckons backwards towards a recent reversal in the mechanics of predictive thought…</p>

                <h2>The Prophetic</h2>
                <p>The prophetic mode of thought traces its legacy from (at least) the Oracle of Delphi through the
                  whole of Christendom. The prophetic mode can be thought of as cryptographic: the future is out there,
                  it is determined and it may yet become known to us if only we learn to practice the proper oracular
                  techniques. Its patrons saints the Greek tragedians, the Jesuit Order and John Winthrop’s “City On A
                  Hill.”
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h2>Contingent (Post-Prophetic)</h2>
                <p>Post-prophetic thought’s relationship to futurity is characterized not by the cryptographic revealing
                  of an extant design, but by the creation of so many ephemeral simulations: probabilistic modeling,
                  weather forecasts, financial speculation & scenario planning. Post-prophetic thought rises after the
                  2nd World War, and is born of, on the one hand, the admixture of information theory, cybernetics and
                  early computing technology and, on the other, the rise of American empire and its management of the
                  geopolitical chessboard during the Cold War. Its patron saints are Herman Kahn and Karl Rove.

            </div>

            <h2>Truth and Evidence in a Post-Prophetic Sense</h2>
            <p>Both prophetic and post-prophetic simulations stage their own truthfulness: For the Prophetic: the Pythia
              emerges from the temple at Delphi dressed in her ceremonial clothes, she speaks in a certain manner. For
              the Post-Prophetic: CNN talking heads have their qualifications listed beneath them as they speak and
              control rooms demonstrate in their illegibility to the general public an obvious technical expertise.In
              the latter case, due to the evolving complexity of the world and the openness of the future, evidence is
              not only the character of things that will come to pass, but the quality of bringing them into being in
              the first place, e.g. the possession of nuclear weapons by Iraq or the labelling of an individual as a
              potential terrorist, drone striking them and then they can no longer testify to their innocence.

            <p>As post-prophetic scrying has become increasingly technically endowed, its deployments have proliferated. A novel typology presents four distinct modes of contingent foresight mapped across the worldly constraints of infrastructure, time horizon, decision protocols, and enforcement. In responding to climate disasters, these four modes will necessarily overlap as systems previously thought independent will be shown to be intertwined. How might these methods of scrying become part of a framework for decision-making and governance at a global scale?</p>

            <h2>Actuarial Foresight</h2>
            <p>
              Actuarial logics derive informatic value in the form of price from the domain of uncertainty, which is
              converted into risk by means of calculation or computation.

              During the 2008 financial crisis, NINJA Loans were awarded based on actuarial calculations. The prices of
              homes would continue to increase even if a percentage of policyholders defaulted. The premise was that the
              value gained from the collection of premiums would always outweigh the risk of the maximum predicted
              number of claims.

            <h2>Resiliency Foresight</h2>
            <p>
              Resiliency as a mode of foresight is about the last disaster and the disaster to come, it is about recursion during a state of emergency. In the wake of 9/11, Hurricane Katrina and the COVID-19 pandemic, it is all too clear how a single event can quickly become a global catastrophe. Emergency preparedness serves to delimit the space of crisis before its emergence. Worst case scenarios, simulation training and disaster exercises join with concrete barriers and earthen levees as experts work to plan for the unplannable. 
            </p>
            <img class="orbs" src="img/orb_blue.png" style="filter: hue-rotate(45deg);"/>
            <h2>Logistical Foresight</h2>
            <p>
              Logistical foresight is about the coordination of material flows in advance. 
              What guarantees supply chain efficiency? What paradigm governs production?           Stafford Beer faces off against Milton Friedman and the Chicago Boys: On the one hand, Project Cybersyn presents President Allende with an informatic representation of Chilean economic activity, allowing him and his coterie of advisors to navigate and steer policy by means of the coordination and management of signals. On the other, the post-coup Chilean economic environment is like a laboratory for the American neoliberals, affording them a testing ground for ambitious ideas about free markets, privatization and deregulation.
              
            </p><img class="orbs" src="img/orb_blue.png" style="filter: hue-rotate(118deg);"/>
            <h2>Interdiction Foresight</h2>
            <p>
              Recall the words of interdiction’s patron saint, Karl Rove:
            </p>
            <p>
              “We're an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality. And while you're studying that reality—judiciously, as you will—we'll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that's how things will sort out. We're history's actors...and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do”
            </p>
            <p>
              Empires know that for history to end, things cannot be allowed to unfold on their own. Paranoia precedes preemption, however, and what follows are drone strikes, PRISM, and the rise of rivals, all necessitating further interdictional thought.
