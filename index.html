            <p>In its Sixth Assessment Report, the IPCC forwards 5 “high confidence” predictions about the risks of
              climate related disasters:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Climate change is already affecting weather in every region of the globe.</li>
              <li>Every increment of warming will intensify hazards.</li>
              <li>Climatic and non-climatic risks interact, creating cascading risks, which are more complex and harder
                to manage.</li>
              <li>Resilient development is enabled by cooperation, including access to financial resources, inclusive
                governance and coordinated policies.</li>
              <li>Adaptation and mitigation measures this decade Delayed action will lock-in high-emissions, raise risks
                of stranded assets and increase losses.</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="img/IPCC.jpeg" style="filter: invert(1);">
            <p>IPCC predictions are generated in part by simulations run on Integrated Assessment Models, which
              manipulate time to stage future interactions between complex systems.
              As the future unfolds, what comes to pass next will take the place of the present in the next run–herein
              lies the recursivity of simulation.
            </p>
            <p>Although the IPCC lacks the tools to produce or negate the futures it scries in simulation, its foresight
              is significant. IPCC foresight is a germ of a planetary sapience, a self-responsibilization of our species
              against the backdrop of an otherwise certain doom.</p>
            <p>The IPCC art of foresight is, however, not a transhistorical given. This simulative knack beckons
              backwards towards a recent reversal in the mechanics of predictive thought…</p>
            <h1>
              A History of Predictive Thought
            </h1>
            <img src="img/delphi.png" />
            <p>From Laocoön and Cassandra to the Cults of Apollo to Sophoclean tragedy, the Hellenic future is destiny,
              it can be affirmed or negated, but never denied. </p>
            <p>In time, the Hellenic strain of oracular thought was appropriated by monotheistic traditions, namely Jews
              and Christians who spoke in the oracular voice in “condemnation of cities and nations for the sins of
              idolatry, licentiousness, and a range of [other] vices.”</p>
            <p>As Christendom took hold during the 1st century, “vivid portrayals of the end times and various
              eschatological conflagration” became a constant feature of the oracular mode.
            </p>
            <p>So much was this the case that in Thessalonians, the Apostle Paul introduced the concept of the Katechon,
              or "that which withholds". The idea of the Katechon was that Christians ought not act as if the eschaton
              is imminent, because a katechonic restrainer holds back the chaos in the days before Christ’s return.
            </p>
            <p>Worth remembering is that in Christian theology time is no ‘long march’ towards salvation but a waiting
              for two simultaneities to join--on the one hand, the historical present and the other, the eschaton, which
              is also the moment of redemption. The function of the Katechon is therefore to produce historical order in
              anticipation of this conjoinment.
            </p>
            <p>From the rise of Christendomin the first century until the middle of the Enlightenment, predictive
              thought flows from this genre of anticipation. The future is out there; it may be a many-forked path, but
              it is determined and it may yet become known if only one learns proper techniques of its divination.
              Hence, this prophetic mode of thought could also be described as cryptographic.
            </p>
            <h1>From Prophetic to Post-Prophetic Thought</h1>
            <p>In the Enlightenment, a new strain of predictive thought is beginning to be born…
            </p>
            <p>Following in the steps of Pascal, Leibniz, Laplace, and Bayes, statistics and probability come of age in
              the nineteenth century as the sciences of state, of population management, of economics and moral action.
            </p>
            <p>What came as a result was a new understanding of causality. No longer was safety purchased by the long
              durees of prophecy and predestination against the randomness of the everyday, but now the statistical and
              probabilistic could rationalize the quotidian and the nearby.</p>
            <p>Not for another 100 years, however, until technical power to act on behalf of statistical knowledge would
              become commensurate with the knowledge itself, would the ramifications of this inflection in foresight
              truly begin to be meted out.</p>
            <p>In the post-war United States, massive military funding had accelerated technological innovation to the
              point where the methods and machines of foresight were commensurate in a unique way: enter the RAND
              Corporation. Born out of a joint project between the Airforce and the Douglas Aircraft company, RAND was a
              tripartite product of computer development, which provided the data processing capability required for
              simulating solutions to intractable problem; game theory, which provided the theoretical structure for the
              investigation of social interaction, and also US military's Cold War need for war game simulation models.”
            </p>
            <p>What RAND did was standardize and operationalize the statistical and probabilistic inflections in
              predictive thought such that they would become the generic containers for conceiving political action.</p>
            <p>Shorn of destiny, the RANDian post-prophetic mode of thought like its predecessor still wishes to stave
              off annihilation and claim victory. However, unlike the prophetic, these outcomes are for post-prophetic
              thought entirely contingent. Victory and defeat do not exist in advance, they are made. </p>
            <p>Recall Karl Rove: “We’re an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality”.
            </p>
            <p>Corporations in particular benefit from the post-prophetic turn in predictive thought, for if the future
              is undetermined, the shareholder value that may be unlocked is unlimited. In this turn juncture, modern
              finance is born and scenario planning goes private as industry adopts Herman Kahn’s methods.</p>
            <h1>Post-Prophetic Thought's Present Reality</h1>
            <p>For the prophetic mode of thought, one or several futures arrive in the present from without. In the
              post-prophetic turn, the future is a contingent thing, we must make it or unmake it through so many
              ephemeral simulations: probabilistic modeling, weather forecasts, financial speculation & scenario
              planning.
            </p>
            <p>Today, we are still manufacturing a Katechon, but in this secular world, there is no longer any
              redemption on the other side. The function of post-prophetic thought is to produce the future as an
              endless present as an endless attempt to manage the overwhelming totality of risk. </p>
            <p>The present eschaton, climate change will test the post-prophetic turn: will this type of thinking be up
              to the task of producing strategies adequate to responding to climate change disaster?</p>
            <h1>Four Modes of Post-Prophetic Foresight</h1>
            <p>As post-prophetic scrying has become increasingly technically endowed, its deployments have proliferated.
              A novel typology presents four distinct modes of contingent foresight mapped across the worldly
              constraints of infrastructure, time horizon, decision protocols, and enforcement.</p>
            <p>Four individual modes of post-prophetic foresight can be unbraided and examined before recombining them:
              they are: actuarial, resilience, interdiction and logistical.</p>
            <div class="orbWraps">
              <img class="orbs" src="img/orb_blue.png" />
            </div>
            <p><b style="color:#233cff;">Actuarial Foresight</b> is the quantification of uncertainty and its conversion
              into financial risk. For
              example, insurance services. Actuarial risk calculation becomes automated governance insofar as it
              automatically polices the boundaries of safe interaction through tools like credit scores.</p>
            <div class="orbWraps"><img class="orbs" src="img/orb_blue.png" style="filter: hue-rotate(284deg);" /></div>
            <p><b style="color:#1f9777;">Resiliency Foresight</b> concerns the last disaster and the disaster to come.
              In the wake of 9/11, Katrina
              and COVID-19, it appears a single event can quickly become global. Resiliency is about containing the
              space of crisis. For example, simulations of earthquakes by the E-Shake Table are used to project how
              buildings must be constructed to withstand future shakes.</p>
            <div class="orbWraps"><img class="orbs" src="img/orb_blue.png" style="filter: hue-rotate(45deg);" /></div>
            <p><b style="color:#8f1fa3;">Logistical Foresight</b> is about planning how material flows. Amazon Freight
              is a case in point as is
              NVIDIA’s warehouse optimizer. Logistical foresight implies not only the coordination of supply chains
              according to consumer appetites but also to environmental needs.</p>
            <div class="orbWraps"><img class="orbs" src="img/orb_blue.png" style="filter: hue-rotate(118deg);" /></div>
            <p><b style="color:#b11b18;">Interdictional Foresight</b> does not wait for threats to appear, it predicts,
              preempts, intercepts, and
              re-directs threats prior to their appearance, shaping the flow of events according to its wishes. </p>
            </p>

            <h1>Simulating the Modes in Context of Climate Change</h1>
            <p>In responding to climate disasters, these four modes will necessarily overlap as systems previously
              thought independent will be shown to be intertwined. How might these methods of scrying become part of a
              framework for decision-making and governance at a global scale?</p>
            <img src="img/ipcc_timeline.png">
            <p>IPCC scenarios present humanity with a snapshot of its means of producing time. In their graphs, we peer
              through bifocals of time and ‘degrees celsius’ and see how actions undertaken in the present recursively
              recalibrate possible futures.</p>
            <p>For the IPCC, simulational power resides with scientific accuracy. That is, the IPCCs powers of action
              are limited, but their epistemological weight is vast. These graphs are interventions at the level of
              foresight where predictive thought becomes an operation on the means of decision-making.</p>
            <p>To judge its success, one considers the frequency of a simulations’ recursion between the model and the
              modeled: how often is the modeled entity impacted by the simulation? How quickly does the simulation
              integrate its own impact as a new input?</p>
            <p>Which modes of foresight we prioritize in responding to the crises of climate change will in large part
              determine our future.</p>
            <h1>Implications</h1>
            <p>This simulational run is an operative exercise in the recursive production of the future, how modes of
              foresight bring variable futures about, and how to plan for those possibilities. Climate change disasters
              require multi-dimensional responses, to build that complexity, simulations must recur astride reality.</p>
            <p>Ironically, although post-prophetic simulations have far more knowledge than their religious forebears,
              what mattered to prophetic thinkers was the known quality of the future, what matters to post-prophetic
              simulations are the unknowns: the spaces of ambiguity and the need for contingency plans. </p>
            <p>If recursive climate simulations are about the constant discovery of new unknowns and their conversion
              into new knowns, are these simulations themselves not an inchoate form of geoengineering?</p>
            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p>What were once theological visions of the future have today become a general symptomatology. Today, all
              life is staked to simulations. To turn off the simulation is therefore to turn off life…</p>
            <p>Simulation addiction is the final destination of all recursion: the infinite regress of the moving image;
              the seductive mirage of the not yet real…</p>
